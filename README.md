# it_cultivars
A coursework project for the classification of Italian wine cultivars using a multilayer perceptron and a random forest classifier.

Includes range testing for learning rates, train/test splits, and visualisations of both for the MLP and RF classifiers. These can be trained on scaled, unscaled, and feature selected versions of the dataset. Good for understanding the relationship between learn rate, training samples, and optimisers. 

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine) is a small, 'well-behaved' (i.e., no missing values, fairly regular feature distribution though classes are slightly unbalanced) example of tabular data useful for testing the first versions of a model or learning projects.
